# Access Job Levels

## Purpose 
This is a quick React proof-of-concept application I made as an alternative to the slide deck that is currently used, 

During the job mapping process, I found that it was challenging because the are gaps in the described roles and that some roles did not match up to industry norms. 

I had to perform job mapping, this meant I had to dedicate time to reading the slides, understanding the roles so that I could apply them to the organisation. 

## Markdown Job Levels

I stored the job levels as markdown because it is easily editted by a human. 

The job levels are available [here](/public/roles)

Not parsing of these is not particularly robust and you must match the format exactly.
